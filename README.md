#
#🔍 Objective
* Reduce false rejections of creditworthy customers caused by traditional risk assessment methods.
* Customize loan structure (e.g., amount, term, interest) based on borrower risk profiles.
* Enable automated risk evaluation to assist credit analysts and improve operational efficiency.
#
#🛠️ Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations with default.
* Handling Class Imbalance using techniques like class_weight='balanced' and threshold tuning.
* Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression (main), Random Forest (benchmark).
* Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC.
* Threshold Optimization to improve business-relevant outcomes (e.g., precision > 0.3).
* Business Recommendation Mapping based on predicted risk score.
#
#📊 Outcome
* Identified important features influencing default behavior.
* Built a risk scoring system to classify customers as Low, Medium, or High Risk.
* Provided strategic business recommendations, such as risk-based loan structuring, early-stage automated screening, and data enhancement strategies.
